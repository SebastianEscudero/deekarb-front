  We are building a **charging system for EV fleets and public stations**, combining **hardware and software** to make charging more **efficient and manageable**.

  ## Why We're Building It  
  EV sales in Chile **doubled in 2024**, but charging infrastructure only grew **by 10%**, creating a major gap.

  ### **Fleets Are Charging Inefficiently**
  - **Higher Costs:** Fleets charge at peak hours (6–10 PM in winter), when electricity is most expensive.  
  - **Battery Wear:** Many fleets use fast chargers when they don’t need to, reducing battery life.  
  - **No Remote Management:** Companies can’t reset, monitor, or generate reports for their chargers.  

  ### **Public Charging Is Not Growing Fast Enough**  
  - The **problem isn’t demand—it’s infrastructure**, as confirmed by **ANAC and SEC**.  
  - Existing companies only install chargers but **don’t provide software** to operate or bill users.  

  ## **Our Solution**  
  We help **fleets charge smarter** and enable businesses to **operate public charging stations**, ensuring that more people can switch to EVs **without running into infrastructure problems**.
